# MousePaw Media: Builder for Dockerfiles

This runs a pipeline to build and push Dockerfiles to registry.mousepawmedia.com

## Requirements and Assumptions

The Jenkins instance using this must provide Docker agents from the
Dockerfiles provided in this repository. These should have the labels
`mpm-CODENAME`, where `CODENAME` is the Ubuntu codename that relates to the
Docker image, e.g. `mpm-focal`.

Git must be configured on the Jenkins instance as well, using the
credential ID `git-ssh`.

The repository must use the MousePaw Media Build System 3.2.0 or later.

## Calling

Onlye one parameter is required when calling this pipeline:

* `repo`: the SSH URL for the repository to clone

```groovy
cppMatrix(
    repo: 'ssh://git@example.com/source/spameggs.git'
)
```

When triggering the build, you may specify any of the following additional
parameters, all of which are optional:

* `BRANCH`: the branch to build/patch on (default `devel`).

The Matrix build will go through six steps:

* Build Environment: build on all Dockerfiles
    * Checkout: Clone the repository and patch in the specified `DIFF_ID` (if any).
    * Login: Login to registry.mousepawmedia.com
    * Build & Push mpm-* Dockerfiles: Build and publish on all mpm-* Dockerfiles
        * Build: Build the image.
        * Publish: Publish the image to registry.mousepawmedia.com
    * Build & Push jenkins.mpm-* Dockerfiles: Build and publish on all jenkins.mpm-* Dockerfiles
        * Build: Build the image.
        * Publish: Publish the image to registry.mousepawmedia.com
