# MousePaw Media: Matrix Builder

This runs a Matrix build according to the MousePaw Media Build System.

## Requirements and Assumptions

The Jenkins instance using this must provide Docker agents from the
Dockerfiles provided in this repository. These should have the labels
`mpm-CODENAME`, where `CODENAME` is the Ubuntu codename that relates to the
Docker image, e.g. `mpm-focal`.

Git must be configured on the Jenkins instance as well, using the
credential ID `git-ssh`.

The repository must use the MousePaw Media Build System 3.2.0 or later.

## Calling

Three parameters are required when calling this library:

* `project`: the name of the project
* `repo`: the SSH URL for the repository to clone
* `branch`: the repository branch to build, usually `devel`

```groovy
myDeliveryPipeline(
    project: 'spam-n-eggs'
    repo: 'ssl://example.com/git/spameggs.git',
    branch: 'devel'
)
```
