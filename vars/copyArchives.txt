# MousePaw Media: Copy Archives Step

This copies the artifacts from the last successful build of the projects that it depends on.

## Calling

Two parameters are required when calling this pipeline:

* `directory`: name of the directory where the project is located.
* `target`: path where the artifacts will be place`

This should be called as a *step* in a pipeline:

```groovy
copyArchives(
    'directory': 'onestring',
    'target': 'workspace/focal/clang'
)
```
