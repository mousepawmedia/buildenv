# MousePaw Media: Checkout Step

This runs a Git checkout step and patches in a Differential, if one is
provided.

## Calling

Four parameters are required when calling this pipeline:

* `repo`: the SSH URL for the repository to clone
* `branch`: the branch name, which will be appended to `refs/heads/`
* `directory`: the subdirectory name to clone into
* `diff_id`: the Differential to patch in; can be an empty string, but should
  not be omitted.

This should be called as a *step* in a pipeline:

```groovy
checkoutStep(
    repo: 'ssh://git@example.com/source/spameggs.git'
    branch: 'devel',
    directory: 'spam-n-eggs',
    diff_id: ''
)
```

That will handle both the Git checkout and the application of the Differential.
